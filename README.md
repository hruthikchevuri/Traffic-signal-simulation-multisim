# Traffic-signal-simulation-multisim

As we have learnt in class how 555 Timer works, we would now like to apply it to practical cases where timing design is very important. Traffic Signals are one such example of the many daily things we see which work on effective timing design. Hence, we felt that it would be good to try to recreate a simple traffic light system at a 4-way junction model along with timing display simulation on Multisim.
